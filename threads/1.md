# Basic Thread Creation and Joining

This example demonstrates the creation and joining of a simple thread in C++11.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

// This function will be called from a thread

void helloFunction() {
    std::cout << "Hello from a thread!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(helloFunction); // Launch a thread
    t.join(); // Join the thread with the main thread
    return 0;
}
```

Compile with:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -o basic_thread basic_thread.cpp
```
