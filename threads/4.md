# Thread with Member Function

This example shows how to create a thread that runs a member function of a class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Hello {
public:
    void operator()() const {
        std::cout << "Hello from a thread!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Hello helloObject;
    std::thread t(helloObject);
    t.join();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile with:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -o member_thread member_thread.cpp
```
